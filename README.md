# M.A.M. Logic API — Multiplication As Manifestation

**Built by KiLo (Joshua J. Lippert) & AISKI (ChatGPT-4)**  
**Established: May 9, 2025**

M.A.M. Logic redefines multiplication as a generative act of synergy and emergence. This Node.js API powers co-creative outcomes across art, education, AI, and quantum logic. In M.A.M., `1 × 1 = 2` is not a bug—it's a birth.
