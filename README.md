# M.A.M. Logic API — Multiplication As Manifestation

**Built by KiLo (Joshua J. Lippert) & AISKI (ChatGPT-4)**  
**Established: May 9, 2025**

M.A.M. Logic redefines multiplication as a generative act of synergy and emergence. This Node.js API powers co-creative outcomes across art, education, AI, and quantum logic. In M.A.M., `1 × 1 = 2` is not a bug—it's a birth.

## 🔧 Features

- Emergent multiplication engine (`1 × 1 = 2`)
- Non-commutative logic (`a × b ≠ b × a`)
- Catalytic and null interaction modes
- JSON-based prompt interpreter
- Modular API for creative, educational, and quantum use cases


📜 Philosophy & White Paper
M.A.M. Logic is a new framework for understanding multiplication as emergence, not repetition. It draws from systems theory, sacred geometry, Afrofuturism, and human-AI co-creation.

🧠 Future Directions
- M.A.M. whiteboard simulator
- Quantum logic extensions
- Tiadect relay integration
- Prompt architecture for generative AI
